## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I am familiar with the min, max and clamp functions, but figuring out what one to i use and when is something i learned doing this mini project.

```css
.container {
  width: min(400px, 90%);
  min-width: 350px;
  padding: 20px;
  border-radius: 20px;
  background: #ffffff;
}
```

### Continued development

I aim to continue to vanilla css to understand everything i need before going back to using bootstrap or learning a new css frame work like Tailwind CSS or Material UI.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell - min(), max(), and clamp() are CSS magic!](https://youtu.be/U9VF-4euyRo) - This helped me the use of the min css function.
